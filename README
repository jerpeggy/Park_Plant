This application is to be placed on a usb drive for use as a Travel Bug dead-drop photo sharing system. Dead-drops are a
way of hiding and sharing information secretly without direct hand-offs. This drive is to be used for any photos of
nature that you would like to share on it as a way to share user experiences in nature with complete strangers. It is
encouraged to take this drive to a new Geocache, in a different place from where you found it, after you upload a
few photos of your own from the place you had found it. You are free to download and use any photos that you would like
from this drive. All the images that are saved to this drive are forfeited from private possession and are released to
the public domain.
